# Pac-Man

## Xtreme edition

What will the application do?

The application will simulate the game Pac-Man. 
The game will include the usual mechanics seen in 
regular Pac-Man, but the twist will be added power-ups. 
The game will include extra power-ups that will buff 
Pac-Man to help player proceed further in game.

Who will use it?

Since I am designing a video game, the audience will be 
video game players.

Why is this project of interest to you?

I've always wanted to work on a personal video game that 
has elements designed and implemented personally. Previously, 
I've designed Snake, and a 2D sand simulator in Java with 
help from either videos, or other people. Pac-Man will be
my first true solo project designed from scratch.
